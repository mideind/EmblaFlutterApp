# Embla

Embla is a voice-driven virtual assistant app that uses the Icelandic-language [Greynir](https://greynir.is) query engine. This is the repository for the cross-platform Embla mobile client.

The client is implemented in [Dart](https://dart.dev/) using the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) framework. Currently built to run on iOS and Android, with native macOS and web support on the roadmap.

## Build instructions

Building the Embla client requires the Flutter framework:

* [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

Clone the repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mideind/Embla
```

Change to the repository root and run the following command:

```
$ flutter run
```

This should launch the app in development mode on your device of choice (e.g. simulator, attached physical device, etc.).
